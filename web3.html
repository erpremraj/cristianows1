        <p>Cristiano Ronaldo dos Santos Aveiro GOIH ComM (Portuguese pronunciation: [k…æi ÉÀàtj…ênu  Å…îÀànaldu]; born 5
            February 1985) is a Portuguese professional footballer who plays as a forward for and captains both Saudi
            Pro League club Al Nassr and the Portugal national team. Widely regarded as one of the greatest players
            ever, Ronaldo has won five Ballon d'Or awards,[note 3] a record three UEFA Men's Player of the Year Awards,
            and four European Golden Shoes, the most by a European player. He has won 33 trophies in his career,
            including seven league titles, five UEFA Champions Leagues, the UEFA European Championship and the UEFA
            Nations League. Ronaldo holds the records for most appearances (183), goals (140) and assists (42) in the
            Champions League, goals in the European Championship (14), international goals (128) and international
            appearances (206). He is one of the few players to have made over 1,200 professional career appearances, the
            most by an outfield player, and has scored over 890 official senior career goals for club and country,
            making him the top goalscorer of all time.</p>

        <p>Ronaldo began his senior career with Sporting CP, before signing with Manchester United in 2003, winning the
            FA Cup in his first season. He would also go on to win three consecutive Premier League titles, the
            Champions League and the FIFA Club World Cup; at age 23, he won his first Ballon d'Or. Ronaldo was the
            subject of the then-most expensive association football transfer when he signed for Real Madrid in 2009 in a
            transfer worth ‚Ç¨94 million (¬£80 million). He became a key contributor and formed an attacking trio with
            Karim Benzema and Gareth Bale which was integral to the team winning four Champions Leagues from 2014 to
            2018, including La D√©cima. During this period, he won back-to-back Ballons d'Or in 2013 and 2014, and again
            in 2016 and 2017, and was runner-up three times behind Lionel Messi, his perceived career rival. He also
            became the club's all-time top goalscorer and the all-time top scorer in the Champions League, and finished
            as the competition's top scorer for six consecutive seasons between 2012 and 2018.</p>

            La Liga titles, two Copas del Rey, two UEFA Super Cups and three Club World Cups. In 2018, he signed for
            Juventus in a transfer worth an initial ‚Ç¨100 million (¬£88 million), the most expensive transfer for an
            Italian club and for a player over 30 years old. He won two Serie A titles, two Supercoppa Italiana trophies
            and a Coppa Italia, became the inaugural Serie A Most Valuable Player and became the first footballer to
            finish as top scorer in the English, Spanish and Italian leagues. He returned to Manchester United in 2021,
            finishing his only full season as the club's top scorer, before his contract was terminated in 2022. In
            2023, he signed for Al Nassr.</p>

        <p>Cristiano Ronaldo dos Santos Aveiro was born on 5 February 1985 in the S√£o Pedro parish of Funchal, the
            capital of the Portuguese island of Madeira, and grew up in the nearby parish of Santo Ant√≥nio. He
            is the fourth and youngest child of Maria Dolores dos Santos Viveiros da Aveiro, who worked as a cook in the
            hospitality industry and a cleaning woman, and Jos√© Dinis Aveiro, a municipal gardener at the Junta
            de Freguesia of Santo Ant√≥nio and part-time kit man for football club Andorinha. His
            great-grandmother on his father's side, Isabel da Piedade, an African woman, was born in the island of S√£o
            Vicente, in what was then Portuguese Cape Verde, and moved to Madeira Island at 16. He has one older
            brother, Hugo, and two older sisters, Elma and Liliana C√°tia "Katia". He was named after actor and U.S.
            President Ronald Reagan, whom his father was a fan of. His mother revealed that she wanted to abort him
            due to poverty, his father's alcoholism, and having too many children already, but her doctor refused to
            perform the procedure. Ronaldo grew up in an impoverished Roman Catholic home, sharing a room with
            all his siblings.</p>

        <p>Both <em>Cristiano Ronaldo</em> and <em>Lionel Messi</em> have scored in multiple UEFA Champions
            League
            finals and have
            regularly broken the 50-goal barrier in a single season. Sports journalists and pundits regularly weigh the
            individual merits of both players in an attempt to argue who they believe is the best player in modern
            football or in the history of the game. It has been compared to several sports rivalries, among them the
            Muhammad Ali‚ÄìJoe Frazier rivalry in boxing, the Borg‚ÄìMcEnroe rivalry in tennis and the Senna‚ÄìProst rivalry
            from Formula One motor racing. Some commentators choose to analyse the differing physiques and
            playing styles of the two. Part of the debate revolves around the contrasting personalities of the two
            players, as Ronaldo is sometimes depicted as an arrogant and theatrical showoff, while Messi is portrayed as
            a shy, humble character. In a 2012 interview, Ronaldo commented on the rivalry, saying: "I think we push
            each other sometimes in the competition, this is why the competition is so high."[106] Alex Ferguson,
            Ronaldo's manager during his time at Manchester United, opined: "I don't think the rivalry against each
            other bothers them. I think they have their own personal pride in terms of wanting to be the best."Messi
            himself denied any rivalry, saying that it was "only the media, the press, who wants us to be at loggerheads
            but I've never fought with Cristiano."
